In the dim, neon-flickering depths of the digital underworld, a new challenge awaits. We are excited to pull back the curtain on <strong>Flame Steel: Death Mask 2</strong>, a multiplayer 3D dungeon crawler that blends retro-cyberpunk aesthetics with modern real-time gameplay.

<h2>🕹️ What is Flame Steel: Death Mask 2?</h2>

Imagine waking up in a procedurally generated maze where every shadow could be another player or a hostile "Filter" entity. <strong>Flame Steel: Death Mask 2</strong> puts you in the boots of a Seeker, navigating a world built on the Flame Steel Engine 2 and Three.js.

The game is currently in its <strong>early stages of development</strong>, but the core experience is already live and ready for exploration.


<h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Multiplayer Exploration</strong>: You aren't alone in the grid. See other players in real-time as you navigate the labyrinthine corridors.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedural Dungeons</strong>: No two runs are the same. The server generates fresh maps filled with mystery and danger.</li>
    <li><strong>The Terminal</strong>: For those who prefer a more "hands-on" approach, an integrated command-line interface allows you to interact with the system directly—perform advanced actions, debug, or simply chat with fellow Seekers.</li>
    <li><strong>Combat &amp; Survival</strong>: Face off against Filters to earn bits, then use those bits to unlock Chests and upgrade your stats. Keep an eye on your health; survival isn't guaranteed.</li>
    <li><strong>Retro-Cyberpunk Aesthetic</strong>: High-contrast visuals and a gritty atmosphere that pays homage to the classic cyberpunk era.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ The Tech Behind the Mask</h2>

Built for the browser, the game leverages:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Vanilla JavaScript and Three.js for smooth 3D rendering.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Node.js and WebSockets (ws) for lightning-fast multiplayer synchronization.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: MongoDB for data persistence and Redis for real-time spatial indexing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🗺️ What’s Next?</h2>

We are just getting started. As an early-access project, <strong>Death Mask 2</strong> will receive frequent updates, including:

<ul>
    <li>New entity types and complex combat mechanics.</li>
    <li>Deeper lore and environmental storytelling.</li>
    <li>Enhanced terminal commands and social features.</li>
    <li>Visual and performance polish.</li>
</ul>
